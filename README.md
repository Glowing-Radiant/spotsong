convert your huge song folder to a spotify playlist with a click.
this script scans a given directory, attempts to find the songs on spotify on the bases of the folder contents and adds them to a new playlist the name of which is taken from the folder name.
 It also creates a log file in the same directory which contains the data of  successful / failed results.
